Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass project was created to train students pass driving test the first time at their local DMV. The client is DriverPass and the system they want to design will be cloud based with the capability of being accessed from anywhere.

What did you do particularly well?
I think I executed the project well.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I have no recomendations for revision.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I interpreted the user's needs and implemented them into my system design by creating the visual diagrams to show interactions between the client software and the user. It is important to consider the user's needs when designing because it lets the user know that their needs are being met to ensure the user stays loyal to your business.

How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
When designing sofware you must understand the requirements for the user and the client. The techniques or strategies that I would use in the future to analyze and dseign a system is by usign visual diagrams and any feedback conducted through surveys or feedback.
